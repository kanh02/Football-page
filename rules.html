												<dt>Fields used within the competition program must

												participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
												field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
												Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
												field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
												field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
												dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
												associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
												required to play all their games away.
												</dt>

														both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field 2
